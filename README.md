# On-the-computation-of-analytic-sensitivities-of-eigenpairs-in-IGA
This repository will contain the Software for the Computation of Analytic Sensitivities of Eigenpairs in Isogeometric Analysis as shown in the Paper "On the computation of analytic sensitivities of eigenpairs in isogeometric analysis" by Anna Ziegler, Melina Merkel, Peter Gangl and Sebastian Sch√∂ps.

We will publish:
-The code to compute the higher order derivatives of the system matrices of the Maxwell Eigenvalue Problem.
-The geometry descriptions of the two considered pillbox cavities presented in the benchmark example. 
-The geometry descriptions of the TESLA cavity and the pillbox cavity for the numerical example on the shape morphing.
